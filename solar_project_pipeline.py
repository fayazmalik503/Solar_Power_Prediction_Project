# ✅ CLEAN WORKFLOW (PIPELINE)

# 🔹 STEP 0: Setup Environment (Before ANY coding)
python -m venv venv              # create virtual env
.\venv\Scripts\activate          # activate env
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib streamlit meteostat jupyter
pip freeze > requirements.txt    # generate clean dependency list

# 🔹 STEP 1: Load & Explore Data (notebooks/01_eda.ipynb)
# - Load CSV from /data
# - Check nulls, datatypes, ranges
# - Visualize trends (line plots, heatmaps)
# - Save cleaned dataframe as processed CSV if needed

# 🔹 STEP 2: Feature Engineering & Modeling (notebooks/02_modeling.ipynb)
# - Select features: temp, humidity, cloud cover, etc.
# - Train/Test Split
# - Train ML model (e.g., RandomForest)
# - Save model using joblib: models/solar_model.pkl

# 🔹 STEP 3: Evaluation
# - Use metrics like MAE, RMSE, R2
# - Plot predicted vs actual
# - Save charts in outputs/

# 🔹 STEP 4: Build Streamlit App (app/app.py)
# - Load trained model
# - User inputs for weather features
# - Predict and display power output
# - Style the app with layout, colors

# 🔹 STEP 5: Version Control (Git)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial clean pipeline"
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/solar-power-project.git
git push -u origin main

# 🔹 STEP 6: Share & Document
# - Complete README.md with sections:
#   - Project intro
#   - Dataset source
#   - How to run app
#   - Sample screenshots
# - Push all to GitHub

# ✅ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID (BASED ON YOUR JOURNEY)
# - Not creating environment at the beginning (creates dirty pip freeze)
# - Mixing Anaconda Jupyter and VS Code (kernel mismatch)
# - Saving model without proper folder path (should be models/)
# - Skipping README or pushing big env files to GitHub
# - Not testing app locally before pushing

# 🎯 GOAL: Reuse this pipeline for every ML project.
# It will make you faster, cleaner, and job-ready.

# ⚡ You’re ready to build like a professional Data Scientist.
